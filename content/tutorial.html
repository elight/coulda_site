%h3 Using Coulda
.section
  %p
    If you don't already, you should create a "test_helper.rb" file, or something similarly named, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> up
    your tests.  In that helper file, you'll want to add the following:

  .code
    %pre
      = TEST_HELPER

  The first line may be redundant if you (or something that you've already required) previously loaded rubygems.

%h3 Features
.section
  %p
    Coulda's take on BDD, based on Cucumber, groups behavior into "Features".  A Feature defines its purpose and
    %em Scenarios
    that explain and exercise that purpose.

  %p
    A pending Feature is a feature lacking any <a href="#Scenarios">Scenarios</a>.  Below is an example of a pending Feature.

  .code
    %pre 
      = PENDING_FEATURE

  %p
    Below is an example of a Feature that contains a purpose.

  .code
    %pre
      = PENDING_FEATURE_WITH_PURPOSE



%h3 
  %a{:name => "Scenarios"}
    Scenarios
.section
  %p
    A Scenario demonstrates one aspect of the Feature.  Often, it's a happy or one of many sad paths exercising the behavior in our Feature.
  %p
    You can write a "pending" Scenario using Coulda as follows:
  .code
    %pre
      = PENDING_SCENARIO
  %p
    Coulda recommends that you express 
    %em Scenarios 
    using:
    %ul
      %li 
        %em Preconditions
        using the 
        %em Given
        method
      %li
        %em Events
        using the
        %em When
        method
      %li
        %em Expectations
        using the
        %em Then
        method
  %p
    The most common use of Scenario would specify at least one Given, When, and Then perhaps as below:
  .code
    %pre
      = SCENARIO
  %h4 Reuse within a Feature
  %p
    If you wish to reuse code within a Feature, you may want to factor behavior out into methods:
  .code
    %pre
      = REUSE_VIA_METHODS
  %h4 Reuse between Features
  %p
    However, if you wish to reuse code between Features, then you should put it in a Module and mix it in.  The below example defines the Module within the same source file; however, it should be obvious that you can do so in a separate file and require it as desired.
  .code
    %pre
      = REUSE_VIA_MIXIN
