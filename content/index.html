  Coulda - Simplifying BDD

%p
  Coulda is YAFTL<a href="#YAFTL">*</a>.  It's a little guy that stands on the shoulders of giants.

%p
  Seriously speaking, Coulda is an internal DSL that is similar to <a href="http://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec-stories">RSpec StoryRunner</a>, the predecessor of 
  <a href="http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tree/master">Cucumber</a>'s <a href="http://wiki.github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/gherkin">Gherkin</a> external DSL.

%p 
  When used, it can look like this:
.code
  %pre
    = MAIN_PAGE_CODE_SAMPLE

%p
  But it can also be easily rendered as plain text (via a rake task) to look like this:
.code
  %pre
    = MAIN_PAGE_PLAIN_TEXT_SAMPLE

%h2
  Getting Started
%p
  Install the gem:

.code
  %pre
    sudo gem install coulda 
%p
  (unless you're using <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com">RVM</a> -- which you probably should be in which case it's "gem install coulda")

%p
  Then write some user stories/features/specs/tests/acceptance tests/your-name-<i>du-jour</i>-for-a-descriptive-testing-artifact

%h2
  Rendering stories as text

%p It's this easy:
.code
  %pre
    RAILS_ENV=test rake coulda:print_features
%p And then you get this:
.code
  %pre
    = MAIN_PAGE_PLAIN_TEXT_SAMPLE
